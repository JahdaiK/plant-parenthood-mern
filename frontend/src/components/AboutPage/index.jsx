            We understand that not everyone was born with a green thumb, but
            fear not, because we're here to change that. Are you tired of
            watching your lovely houseplants wilt away faster than your hopes of
            becoming a master gardener? Look no further! Our app is designed
            specifically for those of us whose plants have seen better days, or
            maybe even better decades.

            nothings to your ferns, we won't judge).
